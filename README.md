An audio controller application which locks output volume at a specified value and matches all applications to that volume. It is a dynamic volume adjuster which balances audio levels ensuring it does not get too loud. 

For future work I want to expand it such that each individual application has its own locked output volume in addition to the overall output volume from all applications.
